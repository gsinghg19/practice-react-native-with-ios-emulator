# practice-react-native-with-ios-emulator

Install xcode before hand for ios emulator software.
run: ' npx react-native start ' to run metro for emulation software
run: ' npx react-native run-ios ' to compile the app and inject into emulator

Note to self: This whole test react-native test folder is using version node 14. If you get errors regarding unsupported envelope problems, check node version. for some reason node versions; node v17 and node v16 do not work and get errors.
